# Weather Dashboard

This application is a weather dashboard that allows the user to input a city of their choosing to receive weather data for that city. Once the city populates it will display the searched city, the current date, an icon representing the current weather conditions, the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, current humidity, wind speed, and current UV index.

The UV index will change color depending on the range in which it falls. Green for a lower UV Index that falls below 3. Orange indicates a moderate UV Index between 3-5. Red alerts for a high/dangerous UV Index and will appear when the UV Index is 6 or greater.



Below the current day forecast is a 5-Day projected forecast for the chosen city. Each of the 5 future dates will be listed along with an icon representing the weather for those dates, as well as the temperature and humidity for those dates.


A user has the ability to search city after city and pull up accurate and current weather data for those cities. This application utilizes a third-party API for weather data. I was able to call back this data based on user input and display it in the DOM in a manner that is easy to use and beautifully displayed.
